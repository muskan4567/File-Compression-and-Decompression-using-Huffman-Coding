File-Compression-and-Decompression-using-Huffman-Coding
Huffman coding compression file is actually to count the frequency of each character in file,then genereate the corresponding encoding for each character in the file,and then save each character in the compressed file in bytes in the form of Huffman coding.
The decompression of files is actually to translate the compressed files and save them to the decompressed files,which need to be completed with the configuration files generated during the compression process.
